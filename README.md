# my personal Emacs config, rewritten

This is an attempt to rewrite and better structure my Emacs
configuration.  Over the last 3 years it did get messy and it is time
for a change.

## Requirements

* Emacs 24 is required.  I might restore core functionalites for emacs
  23.3 in the future,  but my systems all run the latest stable.
* Further programs will be required to get language-specific features
  to work.

## Similar configs

A lot of credit goes to [Steve Purcell](https://github.com/purcell)
and his excellent [emacs.d](https://github.com/purcell/emacs.d).  I
recommend to checkout his repository if you like mine.
